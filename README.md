# BridgeFlow Documentation & Marketing

This repository contains the marketing landing and pricing pages, and lightweight documentation for BridgeFlow — an API integration platform for SMBs.

Contents
- `web/` — Landing page (`index.html`), pricing page (`pricing.html`), styles and minimal JS for local preview.
- `getting-started/`, `guides/`, `api-reference/`, `troubleshooting/` — Documentation content and guides.

Quick start (local)
1. Open `web/index.html` in a browser to preview the landing page.
2. Open `web/pricing.html` to preview the pricing page.

Notes
- Images are placeholders and will be replaced with production assets later.
- This repo is primarily documentation and static marketing assets; it is not a full website build pipeline.
